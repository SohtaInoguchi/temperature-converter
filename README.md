## How to build and deploy the application
Execute `npm run deploy`<br/>
This script builds production build and deploy to Github page.


## How light/dark mode is implemented
Added id to div element that is set at the highest App component, so that it wraps all the child components.
Passed 'theme' state to the id that can be toggled between 'light' and 'dark' with setTheme() function.
Created two versions of CSS for each class and id that are in child component, one version has #light as parent selector and another has #dark as parent selector so every time the the id is toggled between 'light' and 'dark', the corresponding CSS is applied and changing the color theme.


## Rational behind the UI design and application architecture.
the solution that you used. Make sure to include the description on the rationale behind the UI design and the application architecture. It would also be good to explain how you came to the decision on which tools or framework to use.

The button and input is placed top to bottom in the order where user can understand what to do next intuitively - which temperature unit the use would like to convert from => input field => The button to convert => The output.
React is used for this application because of flexibility of JSX and wide range of packages if it needs to be expanded to larger application.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
